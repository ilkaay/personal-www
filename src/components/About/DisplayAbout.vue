          passion. I learned HTML, CSS, JS and after that I learned VUE and
          GraphQL to develop more professional apps. I am still teaching myself
          about front-end engineering and currently I am learning React, React
          Native and Typescript. I am looking for new things to learn, to be a
          better engineer.`
